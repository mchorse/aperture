        "1.3.5": "This tiny patch offers a couple of important bugs, crashes and optimizes performance of path preview when used with velocity control.",
        "1.3.4": "This small patch improves UX experience and also adds Brazilian Portuguese localization, camera profile modifiers, copy-paste modifiers, and improves and simplifies look and follow modifiers.",
        "1.3.3": "This small patch adds more path fixture intepolations, workflow enhancement features (cut, replace and interactively create fixtures) and fixes few annoying bugs.",
        "1.3.2": "This small patch adds a couple of neat features and fixes few annoying bugs.",
        "1.3.1": "Unfortunately, before I released Aperture 1.3, I made a couple of bug fixes. I haven't test it properly and haven't let anyone test it either. However, Agirres spotted my stupidity, and aw shit, here we go again.",
        "1.3": "This is a massive update which adds a lot of advanced camera features which would make new camera moves possible. Beside that, many bugs were fixed, and several features of camera editor were greatly enhanced!",
        "1.2": "This is a major update which features a new camera fixture called keyframe fixture and complete rewrite of GUI code (which allows Blockbuster to more control over integration).",
        "1.1.1": "This is a minor update which fixes some stuff and adds some random stuff regarding the camera. The highlight of this update is the outside mode, which can be used to playback camera while also body acting (detaching yourself from the camera). In some situations it might be glitchy, causing a chunk freeze, but this can be easily fixed by changing render distance.",
        "1.1": "This update fixes a lot of issues and adds few features to camera editor, and introduces camera modifiers. Camera modifiers are special camera behavior modifiers which can be added to camera fixtures. They can process fixture's output in a lot of different ways like shaking camera, looking or following an entity (while still be in the path), apply math formulas and much more!",
        "1.0.1": "This is a small patch update that aims to improve capabilities of the camera editor by adding some new features and fixing some bugs.",
        "1.0": "First release of Aperture mod. This release has everything Blockbuster cameras had but more. It includes its own camera editor, and stuff that other camera mods has. Its all features are frame based, meaning this camera mod would work perfectly with Minema mod and without it."
